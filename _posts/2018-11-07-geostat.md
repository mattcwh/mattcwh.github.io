Illness—and the factors that influence it—may be geographically distributed. If we are to learn about their relations from large-scale population studies we need to model their spatial characteristics. Learning from contemporary brain mapping, we seek to infer a spatial organisation without an assumed spatial structure beyond a reasonable degree of smoothness. This allow us to make formal comparisons between datasets differing in the spatial distribution of their samples, which has the potential of identifying non-intuitive influences on illness for large-scale hypothesis generation. Applying this novel approach to the UCLH patient population will enable us to uncover the complex interactions between healthcare needs and the underlying urban fabric, increasing our power to optimise management for the individual needs of each specific patient, fully cognizant of environmental and other broader influences.
