MRSI: Magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging, alias CSI chemical shift imaging

Proposed MSc dissertation project supervised by Dr Dionisio Acosta Mena. I will evaluate statistical and machine learning methods applied on brain tumour diagnosis support system, as well as develop (from signal processing) and validate (with histopathological and expression data) machine learning prediction models on preclinical multivoxel MRSI data that can be translated to clinical use (further clinical trials).
