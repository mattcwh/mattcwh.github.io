## Name - MCWH
Matthew will do, unless it's the Cantonese pronunciation of the de-romanised Chinese characters "Chung Wai Heng". No reason to confuse yourself by painfully attempting to spit out some gibberish that's supposed to represent me.

## Intro
In general, I'm a biomedical scientist with some computational literacy. I'm reading a Masters in Health Data Science at UCL, and will begin my Wellcome Trust PhD at KCL this year. I'm interested in integrating multiple types of biomedical information with an aim of improving personalised healthcare and precision medicine, which is called "translational bioinformatics" by some. I find motivation and enthusiasm in entrepreneurial and translational ideas stemming from science. While my interests are primarily in Omics research, I'm also curious about biomolecules, statistics, machine learning, science communication, medical technology and health informatics among others. This is a personal site to write about myself, my research works and perhaps some valuable experience I had.

### Experience
+ **AI in Healthcare Research** - UCL and UCLH - 2018-present - *Researcher* - Pilot projects to explore AI/machine learning solutions to existing medical problems, jointly coordinated by UCL and the UCLH Research Hospital Initiative.
+ **Structural Biology Research** - HKU - 2015-2018 - *Researcher* - Supervised by Prof Quan Hao and Dr Yi Wang, we worked on structural and molecular studies to investigate mechanisms of post-translational modification regulation by respective epigenetic proteins, such as SIRT2 and SIRT3 on their defattyacylation mechanisms and BPTF and GAS41 on their crotonylation- and succinylation- binding capabilities.
+ **Influenza Research** - HKU - 2014 - *Intern* - Supervised by Dr Hui-Ling Yen and her team, I cloned and produced soluble haemagglutinin and neuraminidase from pandemic influenza strain A/VN/1203/04 H5N1 using a human cell expression system, validated their function against virus-bound variants and compared activity of wild-type and mild-type haemagglutinin.
+ **Virology Research** - HKU - 2014 - *Intern* - Participated in HIV-CMV studies by assisting RNA extraction, cell culture, infection experiment design.

### Qualifications
+ **MSc** Health Data Science - Institute of Health Informatics, University College London, University of London - 2018-2019 (Expected)
+ **MPhil** Structural and Molecular Biology - School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Hong Kong - 2016-2018 - Thesis titled "A Structural Approach to Protein Intrinsic Versatility â€“ the Tale of Succinyllysine Reader GAS41 and Palmitoyllysine Eraser SIRT3"
+ **BBiomedSc** in Biomedical Sciences, Minor in Genetics and Genomics - School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Hong Kong - 2012-2016

## A few more words
Even though we took exams and critical evaluation for science, it doesn't mean science is confined to an academics' language. Science is a lifestyle. It takes a little bit more brain power, but it asks us to pursue and love truths and stay alerted and critical about the many lies. Still, I am very much an artistic person who enjoys things with an aesthetic value. One of the best and most memorable courses I ever had was Life Drawing at Glasgow School of Art, alongside molecular biology, bioinformatics and cancer genetics. I love nature and wildlife, I'm a traveller, and I love diving. Another unforgettable course is Hong Kong Marine Heritage because we made a documentary about a seaside village so I could dive and film coral reefs. I enjoy watersports and snowsports and more so when with friends and in teams. A bit of good food is always nice, like chocolate and cheese, but I do put a balanced veg-rich diet first.
