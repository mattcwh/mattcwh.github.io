## Wai Heng Chung alias Matthew
I'm a bio-med-health-data scientist, yes, the definition is blurry, but knowledge has no boundaries. I'm reading a Masters in Health Data Science at UCL to complete that equation. My career aspiration, brief and broadly, is to take or create data-driven ideas for personalised health and precision medicine from theory to practice by translational bioinformatics-centered research and more importantly, cross-disciplinary collaboration. That is, I enjoy interaction with people having alternative viewpoints, different specialties, and yet similar minds to "talk big" even when we often need to start small. In an attempt to summarise my academic interests in a few terms, the following would come up: genetics and omics, biomolecules, statistics, machine learning, science communication, medical technology, health informatics, among others. This is a website to describe myself, document my research works and share the experience I had.

### Experience
+ **AI in Healthcare Research** - UCL and UCLH - 2018-present - *Researcher* - Pilot projects to explore AI/machine learning solutions to existing medical problems, jointly coordinated by UCL and the UCLH Research Hospital Initiative.
+ **Structural Biology Research** - HKU - 2015-2018 - *Researcher* - Supervised by Prof Quan Hao and Dr Yi Wang, we worked on structural and molecular studies to investigate mechanisms of post-translational modification regulation by respective epigenetic proteins, such as SIRT2 and SIRT3 on their defattyacylation mechanisms and BPTF and GAS41 on their crotonylation- and succinylation- binding capabilities.
+ **Influenza Research** - HKU - 2014 - *Intern* - Supervised by Dr Hui-Ling Yen and her team, I cloned and produced soluble haemagglutinin and neuraminidase from pandemic influenza strain A/VN/1203/04 H5N1 using a human cell expression system, validated their function against virus-bound variants and compared activity of wild-type and mild-type haemagglutinin.
+ **Virology Research** - HKU - 2014 - *Intern* - Participated in HIV-CMV studies by assisting RNA extraction, cell culture, infection experiment design.

For more details about my research projects, please visit the "Research" page.

### Qualifications
+ **MSc** Health Data Science - Institute of Health Informatics, University College London, University of London - 2018-2019 (Expected)
+ **MPhil** Structural and Molecular Biology - School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Hong Kong - 2016-2018 - Thesis titled "A Structural Approach to Protein Intrinsic Versatility â€“ the Tale of Succinyllysine Reader GAS41 and Palmitoyllysine Eraser SIRT3"
+ **BBiomedSc** in Biomedical Sciences, Minor in Genetics and Genomics - School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Hong Kong - 2012-2016

Computational: Python, R, Stata, Linux, LaTeX
Experimental: Molecular and structural biology

## A few more words
Even though we took exams and critical evaluation for science, it doesn't mean science is confined to an academics' language. Science is a lifestyle. It takes a little bit more brain power, but it asks us to pursue and love truths and stay alerted and critical about the many lies. Still, I am very much an artistic person who enjoys things with an aesthetic value. One of the best and most memorable courses I ever had was Life Drawing at Glasgow School of Art, alongside molecular biology, bioinformatics and cancer genetics. I love nature and wildlife, I'm a traveller, and I love diving. Another unforgettable course is Hong Kong Marine Heritage because we made a documentary about a seaside village so I could dive and film coral reefs. I enjoy watersports and snowsports and more so when with friends and in teams. A bit of good food is always nice, like chocolate and cheese, but I do put a balanced veg-rich diet first.
