"What's your favourite animal?" I've got a few. Cats, curious, observant and quirky. Honey badgers, fearless and unwavering. Crows.

## A Murder of Crows

Crows, the most intelligent birds. They exhibit high adaptability and behavioural flexibility, invading and thriving in non-native habitats. Crows have impressive long-reaching memory and are able to remember faces of both kind and hostile humans and react accordingly. They are capable of social learning by sharing information across the murder and observing neighbours' behaviour, and making group decisions. These black birds have outstanding problem-solving skills and can use tools to find food. So much for the little beings that loudly caw to declare their mighty presence.

## The Black Philosophy

Most crows are black. This may be results of nature's random draw, but if there's an evolutionary cause, the best guess is the ease of identifying individuals in common.

Having All Black as my preferred attire is a little bit more of a rational choice. Matching the skin colour, visually slimming the body shape and keeping warm are some of the practical features. As an easy choice, All Black is humble yet professional. The minimalistic nature frees up the mind to focus on other parts of life. A bit of colourful garnish becomes significantly more profound, perfect for special occasions. The hues of life need not be printed on pieces of loosely attaching clothes.

## Specific Knowledge, Nature and Obsession

Career decisions define one's life, that's who you want to and will become. Some very good advice from [Naval Ravikant](nav.al):
+ arm yourself with specific knowledge, which are usually highly creative or technical
+ but don't be too deliberate, or you'd spent your life and won't love it
+ follow your own obsession then keep an eye out for opportunities
+ pick things where you're a natural and combine them

+ data, extracted and analysed into information, modelled into knowledge
+ biology, complex and stochastic but can work wonders
+ compassion

## A few more words
+ creative art
+ travels and adventures
+ water sports, diving
+ cookery
