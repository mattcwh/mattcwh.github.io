## A very special island - Hong Kong

Hong Kong has a very special place in my heart. It's where I was born, grew up and educated. It's where most of my family and friends are. It's a place that never stops - people, traffic, lights, sounds, culture, coastline, weather, politics. The British (borrowed) and Japanese (WWII) turned the tiny fishing village into an international hub for finance and import-export, as inherited by the PRC. In Hong Kong, we trade space, willingly or not, for convenience and surrounding ourselves with people. We have spectacles you can't easily find elsewhere in the world - concrete forests that light up in regular vertical patterns, the densely packed neon in the night view of the Victoria Harbour, the lovely woodlands and beaches and islands right at our backyards, the clash of eastern and western colours and cuisine on streets lined with futuristic architectures among the antiques, the Cantonese noises and signs printed in traditional Chinese characters. I am proud of our people who risk their lives to defend our unique culture and values.

## On specific knowledge, nature and obsession

Career decisions define one's life, that's who you want to become and will become. Some very good advice from [Naval Ravikant](https://nav.al):
+ arm yourself with specific knowledge, which are usually highly creative or technical
+ but don't be too deliberate, or you'd spent your life and won't love it
+ follow your own obsession then keep an eye out for opportunities
+ pick things where you're a natural and combine them

After some trial-and-errors, this is what I realised:
+ I'm in love with biology and how the nature works
+ I enjoy solving puzzles at a computer
+ I'm amazed by the clever ways people perceive the world by building models from data
+ I still believe compassion should be at the core of what I do

## Healthily Stressed

Here are my ways of managing my mental and physical health:

+ regular exercise
+ creative art
+ travels and adventures
+ water sports, diving
+ cookery (top choice Japanese)
+ lavender and chocolate
+ have a good laugh
+ have the right amount of stress
+ stay focused and be productive at work
+ be mindful
